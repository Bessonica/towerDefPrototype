in folder Assets/Scripts you can find programming part of the project
- right now, we have feald with rows, on which we can place turrets(red square). (Node.cs)
- turrets shoot bullets, that destroy enemies(red dots)(Turret.cs, Bullet.cs)
- enemies can spawn in specified time perioud(every five seconds, or four etc)(wave_spawner.cs)
- enemies move by folowing waypoints, that are placed by developers(waypoints.cs)

- unfinished shop: you can choose turret and place it, but there is no currancy at the moment
 
### next: 
- add loose/win scenario(five enemies reach you-you dead / survive 3 minutes)
- add player controler component and computer to interact with tower defence portion of prototype
