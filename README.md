in folder Assets/Scripts you can find programming part of the project
- right now, we have feald with rows, on which we can place turrets(red square). (Node.cs)
- turrets shoot bullets, that destroy enemies(red dots)(Turret.cs, Bullet.cs)
- enemies can spawn in specified time perioud(every five seconds, or four etc)(wave_spawner.cs)
- enemies move by folowing waypoints, that are placed by developers(waypoints.cs)
