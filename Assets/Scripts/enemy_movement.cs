    //several problems
    //   movement is to static, it feel not as monster but as a machine
    //   need to create methods for scripted events, where you control GROUPS of enemies, 
    //     or all of them

    //look into ai design of pacman games

    //idea for movement: different type of waypoints
    //to simulate/fake carefull behaiviour create differrnet type of waypoints
    //and change them naybe mid game, to simulate learning 
    
    // carefull waypoint, enemies slows down when approaching
    // confident waypoints, enemies go straight to point
    // IDEA: in the beggining put a lot of carefull waypoints
    //       but later change them, as if monsters now confident, they "know"layout

    // question  how create "path" with waypoints for monsters, if there is several paths?
    // monsters move from wp to wp as an array wp[0] -> wp[1] etc
    //    what if we create several sepparate arrays for each path
    //      way1: wp1 wp2 wp3 etc,   way2: wp1 wp2 etc.
    //  !!and by changing array monsters can simulate pathfinding!!
